A simple locally-ran Hospital Appointment System using Java.

This project was a group effort that was submitted on March 23, 2021 as a Final Project requirement during my 1st year in College.

## How to Run
Download the src files and run the Main.java file

## About
An online platform for scheduling appointments in hospitals/clinics with respect to the schedule of doctors
and to the convenience of patients.

## Problems to Solve:
- Ease of Access - patients who want to set an appointment with a corresponding doctor would
need to physically go to the hospital or clinic which would consume more time and effort and
possibly expose them with different diseases especially in times like a pandemic.
- Schedule management – patients who would like to know the schedule of a doctor would need
to go to a hospital or clinic and ask the front desk which is time consuming. Scheduling would
be done manually and will only be given face-to-face a few minutes before the schedule which
may conflict the session and risk misunderstanding and mismanagement.
- Manual Data Handling – nurses and doctors would need to handle patient’s confidential
information which would risk issues such as misplacement of documents and exposure of data.

## Objectives:
- Patients can easily schedule an appointment without physically going to a hospital or clinic.
- Patients can easily see the schedule of every doctor and they can get ready ahead of time. It
will monitor doctors' time and schedule. It will display if a doctor is working, or if a doctor already
has an appointment with a patient, or if a doctor is free. A doctor can easily manage their own
schedule and get ready by knowing the patients that have set an appointment.
- Data handling will be more efficient and organized as patient’s information can easily be
accessed by doctors and nurses without getting the information lost, screwing up data and
without getting exposed to unauthorized access.
